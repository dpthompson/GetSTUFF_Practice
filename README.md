# GetSTUFF_Practice
Creating random projects with form interactions to refresh memory of coding.
Initial form pulls data from SQL and allows a combobox to be filled and then use as filter.
A command button opens a form where a game takes place where user enters how many attemps the user gets to guess a number between 1 and 100
Another command button opens a form where user enters a number between 1 and 100 and the logic will ask the user various questions to try and guess the number
Another command button opens a form that has grid view with user data. This form allows user to double click the grid view to then update values.
